This mandatory information collection (42 U.S.C. 1397hh) will be used to help each state meet the statutory requirements at section 2108(a) of the Social Security Act to assess the operation of the State child health plan in each Federal fiscal year and to report the results of the assessment including the progress made in reducing the number of uncovered, low-income children. Under the Privacy Act of 1974 any personally identifying information obtained will be kept private to the extent of the law. According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information collection is 0938-1148 (CMS-10398 #1).
